              To find your pensions we send the information you have given us to all UK pension providers (thatâ€™s about 36,000 pension schemes). They use your information to see if you have a pension with them.

            </h2>
            <p>
              To reduce the number of pension providers we contact you can create a list of pension providers. We will only ask the pension providers on the list to tell us if you have a pension with them.
